## Objective
Implement and compare different types of sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

## Test Input Sizes
- 10
- 100
- 1,000
- 100,000

## Test Input Sequences
- Increasing
- Decreasing
- Random

## Language and Runtime
- Language: Typescript
- Runtime: Bun (or your preferred Typescript runtime)

I chose to use Typescript and Bun since those are two technologies that I use for work and it is good knowledge to have these sorting algorithms.

## Installation
To install Bun, you can run the following commands:

For macOS, Linux, and WSL:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
For Windows (experimental build):
```powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```
> Keep in mind the build for Windows is experimental and is not as fast or compatible as for Mac or Linux. I suggest using WSL if youâ€™re gonna run this code on Windows. If you need a guide to install WSL, follow my guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mO9zLiJc_oeuXeMjjX0GdOEZW6lvYjpCwce7Vlwup1o/edit?usp=sharing).

After installing Bun, inside of the project directory run:
```
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Usage
If everything was installed correctly you will see

Next you'll be prompted to enter an algorithm number and an array size

![user-prompt](https://github.com/alexkahndev/CS435-Assignment1/assets/140863288/008911dd-07c8-477b-915d-fa2784905d23)

It will generate the increasing,decreasing, and random array of your size and display the generated array along with how long it took

Based on which algorithm you chose the program will use it to sort the array then display the sorted array along with how much time it took

You will keep being prompted to do this until you enter â€˜xâ€™ or â€˜Xâ€™ as and algorithm option, additionally you can kill the program with ctrl + c

## Results
| Sorting Algorithm | Size 10 | Size 100 | Size 1,000 | Size 100,000 |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Bubble Sort       |         |          |            |              |
| Insertion Sort    |         |          |            |              |
| Merge Sort        |         |          |            |              |
| Quick Sort        |         |          |            |              |
| Selection Sort    |         |          |            |              |
